My mother, aged 93, is profoundly deaf and although not physically frail, had been dependent on my father to whom she had been married for 63 years, who passed away in February 2020, in every way imaginable. She has found coping without my father increasingly difficult and has needed assistance with all aspects of her everyday activities. Erica’s duties were extensive: my mother is emotionally frail and her deafness a handicap. She also slowed down physically within the months following my father’s death. Erica was patient and professional and my mother relied on her for the achievement of most daily tasks. It is difficult to make a simple list of duties covered by Erica. Although Erica’s primary commitment was to my mother’s day-to-day needs, the home is a large one with 2 domestic staff and increasing maintenance required in my father’s absence. No two days are the same and plans frequently change at the last minute which is difficult for my mother but always very capably handled by Erica. It is testimony to Erica’s remarkable professionalism and flexibility that she handled every situation with patience and determination, frequently achieving what seemed insurmountable to start with. For much of Erica’s tenure at my mother’s house, South Africa was in lockdown due to Covid 19 and the restrictions onerous and extremely challenging. Very much involved in my mother’s life are her and my fathers 4 offspring: four daughters ranging from 50 – 60 years and of strong personalities. It was always a pleasure to have any contact with Erica. She contributed meaningfully to our family Whatsapp group with regular updates for those of us who live far away. She was always mindful of the family dynamic and respectful of the situation in which we all found ourselves after my father’s death. Erica’s engaging personality, energetic inventive approach to every challenge and unfailing professionalism made her a joy to work with and she will be missed. We wish her the very best of luck in her new venture. Please do not hesitate to contact me at hilary.maude@gmail.co. should you require any further information.",

During all this time, the quality and standard of Erica’s caring skills and attitude was outstanding – I could not have wished for a better nor more reliable person. Paul had unfortunately developed bone cancer which meant that mobility became more challenging and ‘pain management’ became an important factor. Erica was exemplary in both of these aspects and was always keen to get Paul out in the wheelchair for a decent local trip so that he could have a change of scene and get some fresh air. Erica was always kind, considerate, encouraging, cheerful and positive and retained her sense of humour which is so important. Erica liked to keep busy around the house and was also an excellent cook and her meals were greatly looked forward to and much appreciated. Outside of the specific caring role, Erica proved to be very good company and everyone who visited the house said how much they had enjoyed meeting her – good social skills, she was interesting and thoughtful and a good communicator. Regarding professional ability, Erica was competent in all matters from monitoring medication to helping a disabled person to move about safely. In summary, Erica could carry out all of the professional skills that were required to a very high standard. I conclude by saying that I would highly recommend Erica to anyone.",

Janice suffers from advanced stage Alzheimer's. On both occasions Erica managed to provide Janice with kindly care at the same time as undertaking full household duties including providing meals for us both. During her time with us Erica demonstrated a good understanding of Janice's problems as well as administrating all her medication and providing support with hygiene and showering. I would unhesitatingly reemploy Erica to provide Live In Caring Services to our household.",
